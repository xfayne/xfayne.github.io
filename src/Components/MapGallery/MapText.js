            During recent years I traveled a lot and took tens of thousands of photos that were slowly pilling up in 
            folders on my cloud storage. When I wanted to enjoy and watch my photos by myself or with others, I found out that the regular 
            storage folders interface is clearly not the most fun thing for that could be. <br/><br/>

            As a result I've created TravelBloggers - a social network that give the user a beautiful travel blog, very easy to maintain, based on his regular cloud storage and connect him with 
            community for exploring itineraries and trips uploaded by other bloggers.
            <br/><br/>
            After an easy setup, we offer the user a customizable design blog based on his cloud folders pictures.
            The photos from each folder are arranged as a dated itinerary on an interactive map, making it 
            fun to navigate between and inside trips. The blog is being update behind the scences when new pictures are adding to the cloud.
            <br/><br/>
            We offer the user to be inspired by other travelers and reveal new trips and itineraries that done by real people. If the user
            is also maintaining a blog, our algorithms can offer new trips based on his past.
